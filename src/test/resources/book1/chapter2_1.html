    playing career at Norwich City, and feels that his career peaked with what he calls the save of his life in a 1993
    UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich; The Independent called the game the summit of the club's history. He is one of
    only nine players to win the club's Player of the Year award twice and was made an inaugural member of its Hall of
